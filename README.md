# RoboND-WhereAmI-Project

The second project of the Udacity Robotics Software Nanodegree Program Term 2.

In this project, a mobile robot is built and a ROS package that utilizes the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm to estimate the robot's pose is created. Parameters in the [AMCL package](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) is tuned to achieve the best localization accuracy.

More details are explained in the [writeup file](https://github.com/shingo-uzuki/RoboND-WhereAmI-Project/blob/master/submission/RoboND-WhereAmI-writeup.pdf).
